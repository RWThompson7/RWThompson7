This repository contains the culmination of my work efforts at the University of St. Thomas in service of the common good. Across the disciplines of computer science and statistitcs, I've worked to uphold the universities core values in creating exceptional works that serve a multitude of domains. Each project was unique in its approach and execution. They fostered both my individual development and my role as a team player. 

First, the St. Paul Crime Database. A collaborative product of my computer science education in web development, the project highlights the impact of crime on communities through the domain of criminal justice. The project is significant not just for entities in law enforcement, but for empowering communiies to create safer environments themselves. The single-page application provides a user-fiendly experience for visualizing map data and performing database modification; it enables quick access to either empower community leadership to allocate valuable time and resources, or enhances public safety's ability to effectively outreach and improve community relations.

Secondly, the RCDS project gave me a greater understanding of the role that technology plays in the field of education. The web application we created served as a major upgrade for the Risen Christ school's adminstration to better assess and address the needs of each family. The project resolved a major technological hurdle that they suffered, in part due to their commitment to families paying only what they can for a quality education. This project in essence then was about giving back to those in need for a service, and I can think of no better example exemplifying the common good than that. 

Third, my statistics project on Social Capital. One of the given issues that has been creeping against society in the background has been the decline of social capital - the network of relationships that allow for the proper functioning of society. Our statistics endeavor sought to quanitfy exactly how these relationships develop, and in turn create a predictive model in service of providng real world policy solutions for repairing these societal bonds. By presenting on a topic that is commonly passed over, or otherwise ignored, we sought to use the domain of statistics to better incentivize futher research to build upon what we created, in the hopes of making better progress towards unifying members of our society better than before.

Finally, my statistics work on Conway's Game of Life. This demonstrated the significance of computer sciences role in understanding principles in domains such as mathematics, even AI. The Game of Life is a set of four simple rules that simulate the life and death of a simple organism. It's usage is as a thought experiment to view complex patterns that emerge from different pre-arranged shapes and starting points. The project itself can be used in the aforementioned education domain as well, being used to teach younger students about the incredible potential of genetic algorithms and statistics, while also building towards my own personal understanding of the subject matter.

By leveraging technology and computational methods, computer scientists can play a crucial role in solving problems, fostering progress, and improving the lives of individuals and communities in various domains. I hope to use these abilities to my very best as I enter into the professional workforce for the first time.
